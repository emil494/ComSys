In the attic, among boxes of forgotten memories, lay Annabelle, a porcelain doll with once-rosy cheeks now faded by time.
Her previous owner, Lily, had outgrown her, leaving her discarded among other relics.
But at night, Annabelle was far from dormant.

One evening, the household cat, Whiskers, hissed at the attic door.
Curious, young Emma, Lily's sister, ventured up, drawn by a soft lullaby.
There sat Annabelle, her eyes now a deeper shade, holding a small music box.

Transfixed, Emma reached out to take the box, her fingers brushing Annabelle's.
That night, dreams of endless, twirling dances consumed Emma.
She woke, feeling drained, with the doll now at her bedside.

Each night, the same dream. Each morning, Emma grew paler.
Lily noticed, recalling her own childhood fatigue.
She stormed the attic, grabbing Annabelle, and locked her in a chest.

But, the next morning, Annabelle was back on Emma's bed.
Desperate, Lily threw the doll into the river.
Yet, at night, a wet lullaby echoed through their home.
And in the morning, two porcelain dolls sat side by side, with rosy cheeks and deep, knowing eyes.
