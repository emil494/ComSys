In the stillness of night, the old grandfather clock ticked away. 
Every tick resonated through the empty hallways of the forgotten mansion. 
On this particular evening, a soft, hesitant knock echoed at the main door. 
No one had visited in decades.

Against better judgment, Marianne opened it, revealing only darkness outside.
A chilly breeze swirled in, whispering unintelligible secrets.
From the void, a tattered doll landed on the threshold.
Its glass eyes shimmered, reflecting the moonlight.

Marianne, curious, picked it up.
That night, she heard giggling from empty rooms.
Shadowy figures danced just outside her vision.
The doll, now perched on her dresser, watched intently.

Morning never came. 
The mansion remained trapped in eternal twilight.
With every passing hour, Marianne's memories faded.
Only the doll's laughter grew louder.

By week's end, the mansion was silent again.
Another knock echoed one fateful evening.
A new occupant, lured by the house's charm, entered.
The grandfather clock ticked, and the cycle began anew.
